# Contributing to SentryXDR

We love your input! We want to make contributing to SentryXDR as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/akefallonitis/sentryxdr/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/akefallonitis/sentryxdr/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Follow C# coding conventions
* Use meaningful variable names
* Comment complex logic
* Write XML documentation for public APIs

## Code Review Process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks, we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community

* Be respectful
* Be collaborative
* Accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show empathy towards other community members

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue for any questions or concerns.

## License
